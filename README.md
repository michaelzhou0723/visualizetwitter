# Visualizating Twitter
<br />
<br />
This project aims to graphically represent the following information about Twitter given a keyword (or hashtag).
<br />
  - Number of tweets posted each day in the past week containing the keywords
  - Popular terms appearing in those tweets
  - Geographical positions of authors of those tweets
  - The most retweeted tweets containing the keywords
<br />
In this project, Python is used for scraping tweets and outputting processed data in JSON format. The tweets are stored in MongoDB. Data visualization is done by D3.js and Leaflet.js.
<br />
> The Twitter Search API is not aimed for completeness, so some tweets may be missing from the result. However, the general trend should not be affected.
